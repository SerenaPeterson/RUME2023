# RUME2023

Welcome!  In this repository, you will find several documents.  In one of them, I have included a list of informative websites that have helped me learn the basics of sentiment analysis and text mining in this independent, exploratory project.  In addition, I have included Python code for preprocessing and analyzing text data as well as the R code I used for statistical analysis on this new dataset (i.e., included numerical output of the sentiment analysis).  Note that these analyses most certainly can be conducted in Python, but due to my own comfort with R, I chose to make the switch.  A reference list of relevant literature is also provided.
